<h2 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h2>

<p>This is a list of useful Minecraft tools, software, websites, <a href="/cheatsheets/">cheatsheets</a>, etc. This website also contains a <a href="/a/">blog</a> (still in development) and other small pages.
This website has evolved far beyond just a list.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>A few days ago (for me, December 2025) I was searching for Minecraft websites — when I’m bored or just feel like something’s missing I search for nerdy websites — but I didn’t really find a list. (Although there are <a href="a/other-lists">a few</a>.) If you look at this list, you might say: “But there are a few of them, so why did you make this list?”
And that’s <em>kinda</em> true: only the first few links are actual lists with more than 20 items and different core ideas, so I wanted to <em>merge</em> them and add more items. (And I did: as of 30 December 2025 the list contains 157 items!)</p>
